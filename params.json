Examples:\r\n  - \"don't\" is a contraction of \"do not\"\r\n  - \"it's\" is a contraction of \"it is\"\r\n  - \"let's\" is a contraction of \"let us\"\r\n- Use an apostrophe for possessives of nouns, *but not pronouns*.  Examples:\r\n  - \"John's thing\" means \"thing\" belongs to \"John\"\r\n  - \"its thing\" (*no apostrophe* because \"it\" is a pronoun) means \"thing\" belongs to \"it\"","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
